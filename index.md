# About

Hi!
I recently graduated from Seoul National University with a double major in Computer Science and Engineering and Mathematical Sciences.
My primary interests lie in reinforcement learning theory and, more broadly, decision-making under uncertainty, including areas such as multi-agent learning and game theory.

Here is my [CV - Curriculum Vitae](/file/harin_cv.pdf).  
While CV contains my academic or other offical records, you can check out my [Somewhat Unofficial Records and Facts](/surf) at the link.

### News
I am delighted to announce that two of my papers, *Lasso Bandit with Compatibility Condition on Optimal Arm* and *Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Quasi-Optimism*, have been accepted at ICLR 2025! Details will be updated soon.

### Experiences
I am fortunate to work as an undergraduate researcher under the supervision of Professor [Min-hwan Oh](https://minoh.io) at Seoul National University.
So far, I have written three papers: one is soon to be published, and the other two are currently under review for a conference.

In addition, I have actively participated in competitive programming.
I competed in the 47th ICPC World Finals in Luxor, Egypt, in April 2024 and won a Silver Medal (7th place) and was named Asia Pacific Champion, which was an incredibly exciting experience.

### Blog
I write blog posts on noteworthy mathematical topics.
I am also planning to share my thoughts on reinforcement learning and learning theory.
I might add commentaries on my papers, though most of the time the papers should explain themselves sufficiently.
